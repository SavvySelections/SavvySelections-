This Is Me

🖤 I work part-time as an independent agent at Appen Limited, a data collection agency, to enhance machine learning and AI products. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology at the University of Arizona Global Campus. I am enriching my education while working outside my hometown in central Texas, where I was born and raised. I have recently embarked on my college journey as a first-generation and non-traditional student. 🖤

🤍 With more than ten years of experience in customer service, including a management role for half of that time, I have built a solid foundation in interpersonal skills and social competencies. My skills in communication and problem-solving are exceptional. I can think critically and outside the box as a detail-oriented and results-driven individual. Furthermore, I am a self-motivated individual with a strong work ethic. By leveraging my existing expertise, top qualities, and forthcoming degree, I aim to pursue a therapy profession that maximizes using my unique abilities to assist people who share similar life experiences. During my leisure time, I relish listening to diverse genres of music (always singing along) and composing short stories and poetry or reading. Additionally, I always make ample time to bond with my loved ones. 🤍

❤️ Throughout my life, I have witnessed numerous transformations as time has passed. Like everything else in life, I have changed and evolved into the person I am today. Therefore, my values and beliefs have fused to propel me toward the future. To reach my full potential and be able to assist others effectively, I must have high expectations for myself and strive for excellence. My ethos is defined by three core values and attributes, which serve as the guiding force toward my future achievements. First, I must develop resilience in all aspects, especially when pursuing my education and nurturing my cognitive abilities to consistently perform at my highest potential. Second, to continually promote social justice, it's crucial for me to constantly work on maintaining genuine empathy and respect for everyone around me. Third, I am committed to maintaining a mindset focused on personal and professional development while always holding myself accountable to the highest standards of honesty and ethics, serving as a model for others to follow. ❤️

🧚‍♀️ As time has passed, goal setting has become more and more important to me. It is crucial to achieve these goals rather than just establishing them. Humanity shines brightest when pursuing progress and embracing change. In other words, the pursuit of improvement. I strive every day to do and be better than I was yesterday! 🧚‍♀️

The well-known artist Pablo Picasso said, 🗨️Our goals can only be reached through a vehicle of a plan, in which we must fervently believe, and upon which we must vigorously act. There is no other route to success.🗨️ (pablopicassoquotes.orgLinks to an external site.)

Picasso's words convey that the secret to success lies in having a clear objective, a well-defined strategy, and a dedicated effort. Setting goals is crucial regardless of the field in which we aspire to excel or the success we seek. Setting and pursuing goals is vital in shaping one's life and should never be underestimated. Achieving great heights in one's career or creating a fulfilling and satisfying life is achievable. Goals are indispensable to achieving that. 💋
